The XXXG-01D Gundam Deathscythe (aka Deathscythe or Gundam Zero-Two)
, is the second of five Gundams sent down to Earth from the Space Colonies
in Gundam Wing. It was piloted by Duo Maxwell.It was developed to be a master
of infiltration, relying on shock and awe tactics to quickly and effectively
accomplish its missions.
To this end, one of its primary features was a pair of Hyper Jammer ECM suites
mounted on its backpack. When in use, they prevented the Gundam from showing up on
radar or visual sensors.
