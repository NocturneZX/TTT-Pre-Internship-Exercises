The XXXG-01D Gundam Deathscythe (aka Deathscythe or Gundam Zero-Two)\n
, is the second of five Gundams sent down to Earth from the Space Colonies\n
in Gundam Wing. It was piloted by Duo Maxwell.It was developed to be a master \n
of infiltration, relying on shock and awe tactics to quickly and effectively \n
accomplish its missions. \n 
To this end, one of its primary features was a pair of Hyper Jammer ECM suites \n
mounted on its backpack. When in use, they prevented the Gundam from showing up on \n
radar or visual sensors, rendering it invisible to most electronics. This allowed it \n
to sneak into facilities and even right up to enemy mobile suits without being detected.\n
